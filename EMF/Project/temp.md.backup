# How do s deal with regulatory authorities?

 What are the regulatory authorities -
 
 1. If the company is registered on the stock exchange it needs to strictly follow all guidelines issued by the board (for example SEBI in India).
 2. Also, In india it has to abide all the rules and regulations imposed by the elected government. 
 3. Alos its worth mentioning that the regulatory body needs not be a government agency always, it can be a private player also. For example, If we run a college that is affiliated to some private university then we need to abide all the regulations issued by the private university. 
 4. Another example, if we runs a youtuve channle (a very big channel) then it is required to follow all the guidelines issued by youtube otherwise it will not be possible for us to upload the videos and earn money to sustain the business
